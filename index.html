            <h1>About Gershinen Shanding</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            I am Gershinen Shanding, a passionate Python Data Scientist and technology advocate dedicated to driving social change and fostering impactful innovation. 
            As a Graduate Member (GMCPN) of the Computer Professionals Registration Council of Nigeria (CPN), I uphold the highest standards of professionalism and excellence in the tech ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a strong focus on ethics and social change, I am particularly interested in applying data science to policymaking and addressing prevalent societal issues such as out-of-school children, 
            climate resilience, and equitable access to resources. I believe in creating systems that not only tackle immediate challenges but also build long-term resilience for vulnerable communities. 
            My proactive approach prioritizes preventing crises before they occur, ensuring sustainable and meaningful solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I serve as a Data Scientist at eHealth4Everyone in Abuja, leveraging data-driven methodologies to enhance healthcare systems and deliver better outcomes. 
            I am also the founder of GERANDCO Technology, a company that provides innovative solutions including web design, AI-driven tools, and data insights platforms. GERANDCO’s mission aligns with my vision 
            of empowering businesses, governments, and organizations to make informed decisions through technology and data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my professional roles, I am involved in projects that intersect technology, ethics, and sustainability, and I am committed to bridging the data literacy gap. 
            From building platforms that provide actionable insights for businesses and policymakers to engaging in the ethical application of AI, my work reflects a deep commitment to leveraging technology for the greater good.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not working, I enjoy mentoring aspiring data scientists, exploring coding challenges, contributing to community-driven tech initiatives, 
            and indulging in my love for sports, particularly football. My journey is driven by a continuous thirst for learning, collaboration, and innovation to create a more equitable and resilient world.
